                    <h3>About the game</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the course Retro Console & Emulator Programming we learned about the hardware of the NES and then had to make a game that would run on the hardware of the console. In a team of three people we decided we wanted to remake a classic game, snake.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I worked on the displaying of the body and using the nametable to display the body. Only the head and food were stored in the oam. This way we could display a snake that could get as big as the whole screen. Before that we were limited by the size of the oam, this has a size of sixty-four. Using the oam we would also be limited to only display eight sprites per line. We also needed to change the calculations of the body since the calculations would now exceed the size of a register. This meant that we needed to use a low and high bit to calculate the place of the body.</p>
                    <h3>Other information</h3>
                    <p>
                        We used assembly 6502 and the Mesen emulator to make this game.
